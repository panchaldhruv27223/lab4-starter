## Todayâ€™s Motivation
"Every great model starts with a single line of code, and every skill with a single step of practice. Stay consistent, stay curious - because progress in machine learning, like in life, comes from persistence." - Dhruv Panchal

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (DataPreprocessingWithScikitLearn.ipynb) that demonstrates the essential steps of data preprocessing using Python and scikit-learn.

---

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed.
- Basic understanding of Python.
- `pip` installed in your terminal/command prompt.

---

## Setting Up the Environment
